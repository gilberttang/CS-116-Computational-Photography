CS116 Project 1: Image Filtering
Only Question 5 and Question 6 is related to image processing.

Question 5: Average images
Load a a collection of images(set1 and set2), compute the pixelwise average of the images, and display the results.

Question 6: Color sensor demosaicing
Write a demosaic function to compute the missing color values at each pixel in IMG_1308.pgm to produce a full RGB image.

Programming Language: MATLAB
My part: HW1_Q4.m, HW1_Q5.m and HW1_Q6.m

The result is shown in the writeup file.
